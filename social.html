                                    OOPERAI is philanthropic foundation for built environment awareness at early ages.In 2011, a foundation called OOperai was created in Panama with the scope to give accessibility to a creative and evaluative training of the built environment at early ages. For almost three years, OOperai have focused on children from six to twelve-year-old from low-income and conflict rural and urban settlements, which due to their rapidly growing population often encounter a lack of values in their lived spaces and a diffuse sense of quality in their immediate built environment. In 2013, OOperai started a project in India with children from Chennai and Mumbai, where we are implementing more creative engagements and exchanging their issues regularly. As part of this vision, OOperai has been responsible to implement international exchanges of built environment experiences between children from more than ten countries, with the scope to validate learned and experienced architectural typologies between Panama with a methodology called type.

                                    Project Leaders are Bhoomi Mistry (IN), Hari Krishnan (IN), Jorge Barrantes (PA), Carlos Arrocha (PA) and Francisco Alveo (PA)

                                    Rotaract Club of NITK is one of the five exclusive clubs of the institute as well as the sole socio-cultural club. Having its accreditation from Rotary International, established in 1962, Rotaract Clubs (or “Rotary in Action” as they call it) reach international standards. The term “Rotaract” is the culmination of the words “Rotary” and “Interact”. Rotary International is an international, secular organization formed for the purpose of bringing together business and professional leaders in order to provide humanitarian services, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. Rotaract Clubs worldwide are sponsored and supported by Rotary International. Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in 1968 at Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, and has grown into a major Rotary-sponsored organization of over 9,539 clubs spread around the world and 219,397 members. It is a service, leadership and community service organization for young men and women between the ages 18–30.

                                    The club conducts various events over multi-faceted disciplines – Social, Cultural, Technical and Literature – and has therefore established itself as the only club to be conducting events across all domains for students and club members alike. Some of the events conducted last year were Headstart, Game of Thrones, JAM, Bluff master, Blockbuster, Rubik’s cube workshop, sign language workshop, Raazmataz, Fragfest, etc.

                                    Keeping Rotary International’s motto of “Service Above Self” in mind, Rotaract Club, NITK Chapter aims at the development of young adults as leaders in their communities and workplaces. For the purpose the club has brought up SIG’s or Special Interest Groups like Tronics SIG and Comps SIG for those inclined towards the technical field, Literary and Arts SIG for the readers, Finance SIG, etc. with their own weekly schedules. Similarly Rotalks is a platform for the speakers, the philosophers and the debaters to let their heart out.
